**Technology:** HTML5, CSS3
The animation is divided into 2 parts.
Firstly four sections composed from description and icon fly in sequentially, then articles in each section move to sides sequentially. Next the color of icons is changed sequentially.
Finally, the sections fly out of the screen all at once in different direction (left or right).

The second part of animation is composed of the appearance of two texts (by getting bigger) and fly-in of the third one. Then all of them rotate around their X axis and they disappear by getting smaller.
