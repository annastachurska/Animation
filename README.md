**Technology:** HTML5, CSS3.

The animation is divided into two parts.
Firstly four sections composed of description and icon fly in sequentially, then articles in each section move to sides sequentially.
Next the color of icons is changed sequentially.
Finally, the sections fly out of the screen all at once in different directions (left or right).

The second part of animation is composed of the appearance of two texts (by getting bigger) and fly-in of the third one. Then all of them rotate around their X axis and they disappear by getting smaller.
